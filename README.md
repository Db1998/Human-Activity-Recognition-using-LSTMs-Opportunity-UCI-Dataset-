## Human Activity Recognition using LSTMs - Deep Learning
### Successfully designed and trained several neural network models using LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory networks) for recognizing Human Activities by taking raw data from the sensors as a part of the course Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic.
### 1) Opportunity dataset was used, which required a high amount of preprocessing like differentiating data into training, cross-validating and testing data, handling clusters of NAN values, converting data to its absolute values, eliminating certain similar columns based on their correlation values and converting 2-D data to 3-D for easy training of LSTMs.
